1)Java:
Java is a programming language
Java invented by James Gosling in 1995
Java is loacted between c++ and python
its a object oriented language
its a platform independent
its having wora(write once run anywhwre)
java is human understandable language

javac:
Javac is a java compiler
its help to run the program
it converts source code into bytecode by the help of compiler in the JVM
its located inside the JDK

2)
JDK:Java Development Kit
Jdk is having the jre and jvm 
By usig jdk the program will run

JRE:Java Runtime environment
JRE is help to store docs,libraries
In jre the jvm is exist
JRE is help to support runtime environment to the program

JVM:Java Vertual Machine
it help to convert .java extension into .class extension using compiler inside JVM
jvm is invisible
jvm will help to convert source code to bytecode

3)
Limitations of array:
Array is a container which stores the similar type of data
Array having homogenous data type storage
Array will using the flower braces i.e, {}

4)
Class: 
its the instance of the object
its the blueprint
class contains polymorphism
Without class there is no program

Object:
Object is the real instance of class
object will stores the data 

Signature of the class:
class class_name(){
}

5)
.java file:                                                       .class file:
it stores the data in .java extension                          It stores the data in .class extension
.java stored before compilation                                .class stored after compilation
.java is will be used by self                                  .class is used by programmer


6)
Method Signature:
access specifier  non-access specifier  returntype  method_name(parameters) throws class_name class_name.

Access specifiers:
public
protected
private
package default

Non-Access Spesifier:
static
final
abstarct

returnType:
void 
data types:1)Primitive datatype 2)Non-Primitive Data type
             *byte                  *Class names
			 *short                 *String
			 *int 
			 *long
			 *float
			 *double
			 *boolean
			 *char

Method_name(parameters)
its a method which will give name to it and passing the arguments


7)
JAVA:
Its a programming language
Its a object oriented programming language
its a platform independent
it consists of wora
wora=Write once run anywhwre
its a human understandable language
JAVA loacted between c++ and python

8)
Java IDE's:
IDE:Integrated Development Environment
Java IDE's:
eclipse

9)
Variable:
Variable is a container which store the data
variable stores the reference of that data
variable will not fixed it will be esaily modified
variable store the date and its easily override

variable types:
1)Static variable
2)local variable
3)Instance variable
4)Parametersized Variable

1)Static variable:it will used static keyword
2)local variable:it will be easily accesible wthin the method
3)Instance variable
4)Parametersized variable

10)
JAVA Keywords:
byte short int long double float boolean character String true false static void public protected private final abstract 

11)
Class Variable:
which declares the variable inside class
class variable is a container which stores the data

12)
DataType:Data types are used in which we are going to use the reference of variable
DataType: 
1)Primitive Data Type
byte:1 byte 
short:2 bytes
int:4 bytes
long:8 bytes
float:4 bytes
double:8 bytes
boolean:1 byte
char:2 byte

2)Non-Primitive datatype
String, class_name, etc

13)
Dot Operator:
Its a same like that of java

14)
Java features:
java is a having independent platform
java is oop language
java container wora
java is in between c++ and python
its a human understandable language

15)
Base class of all classes:
Polymorphism
Inheritence
Encapsulation
Abstarct method
