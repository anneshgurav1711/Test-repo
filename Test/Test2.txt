1)Explain Java Components?
Ans)Java Components are JDK,JRE,JVM:
*JDK::Java Development Kit
    >consist of JRE,JVM and set of libraries.
	>JDK will provide the  environvenment to develop the application.
*JRE:Java DEvelopment Environment
	>Its consits of JVM and set of libraries
	>its physically exist.
	>It provides the runtime environvenment to develop the software.
*JVM:Java Virtual Machine
	>Its consist of set of libraries.
	>It phsically not exist.
	>Java compiler converts sourceCode into byteCode and JVM will exicute the byteCode.
	>During the time of byteCode execution JVM will provide runtime environvenment to execute the byteCode.
	>JVM function:
			*Loads the Bytecode
			*Verifies the Bytecode
			*Run the Bytecode
	
2)Explain Java Features?
Ans)
*Platform Independent
	>Once compiled Bytecode can run on any platforms likes MacOs,Linux,Windows.
	>Its run on priciple of WORA
	>WORA:Write once and run Anywhere.
*Simple:
	>Its easy to learn and easy to understand
	>Its will provide robust
	>Syntax is very easy
	>Run on any java platform
*Secured:
	>Its very secure because its have its own JVM.
*Robust:
	>Block of codes executed concurrently.

	
3)Explain constructors and its types?
Ans)
*Constructor are used to Intialize the instance Variables.
*Constructor copy can be created by using new Kyeword.
*Constructors are same name as a Class name.
*Constructor are not having any returnType.
*Constructor are used for chaining purpose.
*Constructor are mainly having this and super Keywords.

//Types of constructors:
>Default constructor.
>Parameterized Constructor.

4)Explain Variables and its types?
Ans)Variables are the continers which are used to store the data while the time of execution.
//Types of variables:
1)Class level variables
	*Static variables
	*Non-static variables or Instance variables.
2)Method level variables
	*Local variables
	*Parameterized Variables.
	
5)Why java is not pure object oriented programming language?
Ans)
*Java is not purely object oriented programming language because its supports Primitive DataTypes.

6)Explain dynamic binding and static binding?
Ans)
*Dynamic Binding in which programs runs concurrently
*Static Binding in which programs runs by using concurrently but by using classNames.


7)Explain OOP's concept?
Ans)
*OOP:Object Orineted Programming Language
*OOPs are used to write a software in correct manner.
*OOPs having 4 Principles:
	1.Polymorphism
	2.Encapsulation
	3.Inheritance
	4.Abstarction
//Polymorphism:
				>A class having same names with differnet forms.
				>Poly means Many and Morphism means Forms.
//Encapsulation:
				>Hiding the data and giving access by using methods.
				>In this Getters and Stters methods are used.
				>Getters are used to get the objects
				>setters are used to initialize the object
//Inheritance:
				>Use the properties of parent class in sub class by using extends keyword is called Inheritance
				>Access the properties of parent class in sub class by using extends keyword.
				>There are 4 types:
					1.Single Inheritance
					2. Multiple Inheritance
					3.Multilevel Inheritance
					4.Hirarchical Inheritance
					5.Hybrid Inheritance
//Abstarction:
				>Hiding the implimentation and showing only functinality is called Abstarction
				>Abstarction can be achieved by Making class as a abstact and method contains conctete and abstarct methods also..and contains static methods.
				>Abstarction implimentation use by sub class by using inheritance.

8)Write a program to count the number character in given string?
Ans)


public class CharacterCount {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
        String str = input.nextLine();
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
            if (str.charAt(i) != ' ') {
                count++;
            }
        }

        System.out.println("The number of characters in the string is: " + count);
    }
}



9)Write a program to count the number of words in a given sentence?
Ans)


public class WordCount {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a sentence: ");
        String sentence = input.nextLine();
        int count = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < sentence.length(); i++) {
            if (sentence.charAt(i) == ' ') {
                count++;
            }
        }

        System.out.println("The number of words in the sentence is: " + count);
    }
}


10)write a program to reverse an array?
Ans)
public class ReverseArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        System.out.println("Original array: " + Arrays.toString(arr));

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length / 2; i++) {
            int temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[arr.length - 1 - i];
            arr[arr.length - 1 - i] = temp;
        }

        System.out.println("Reversed array: " + Arrays.toString(arr));
    }
}



11)Explain Interface?
Ans)
*Two standard classes are connected by the interfaceClass is called Interface.
*Interface class only achieve 100% abstraction.
*Interface class contains implicitily abstact methods and class also a abstact class.
*Interface class will be implimented by sub class by using implimets keyword.
*Interface class acts like a bridge to connect two standard classes.

12)Explain Exception?
Ans)
*Exception is an exceptional event occured during execution of programs.
*Exception envent created manually by using throws keyword.
*Exception envent handled by using throwable keyword
*Exception can be handles by using 
		>try,catch,finally methods.
*Exception will contains Exception,RuntimeException,ErrorException.

13)Explain Acces-Specifiers?
Ans)There are 4 access-specifiers are there:
*Public:
	>its a keyword.
	>The properties and methods can be accessed anywhere.
	>Public access-specifier will run on any class and any package.
*Private:
	>Its a keyword
	>It can be accessed within the same class only
	>it cannot give access to same package and differnet package
*Protected:
	>Its a keyword
	>It can be accessed within the same package and outside the package only by sub class buy using extends keyword.
	>It can be accessed in differnet package.
*Default:
	>Its a keyword
	>It can be accessed within the same package and same class.
	>default will provided by compiler if we not mentioned as default.
	
14)Difference between Abstraction and Interface?
Ans)
//Abstarction:
	>Hide the implimentation and showing only functinality
	>It will not give access to any of the sub class to impliment
	>It will not connect two standard classes
	>Access by using extends keyword.
	
//Interface:
	>Hide the implimentation and give the access to sub class to impliment the method
	>It will give access to any of the sub class to impliment
	>It will not connect two standard classes
	>Access by using impliments keyword
	

15)Write a program to get the sum of all digits? Ex:i/p:234 o/p:9
Ans)
public class SumOfDigits {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int num = input.nextInt();
        int sum = 0;

        while (num > 0) {
            int digit = num % 10;
            sum += digit;
            num /= 10;
        }

        System.out.println("The sum of the digits is: " + sum);
    }
}
